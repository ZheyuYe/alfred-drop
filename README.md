An Alred workflow supporting photo host

This is a forked repo of https://www.packal.org/workflow/drop which is authored by [@Acidham](https://github.com/Acidham). It is a useful tool to upload local picture to your personal dropbox photo host allowing public access and download. One of the practical operation is to generate external links for markdown images.

### Modification 

* Get long URL instead of short sharing link
* replace the  https://www.dropbox.com/ with https://www.dropbox.ubuntuhot.com/ for the purpose of global access.
